# Derivative-pricing-in-Python
Hi, welcome to the Derivative-pricing-in-Python repository! As from my enrolment in a quantitative finance course, and also to gain expertise in Python language, I decided to work out the fundamentals of derivative theory by developing this set of jupyter notebooks. The code is a mix of that developed by other authors (please refer to the references inside each notebook) and my own contributions. Since I am not a skilled programmer, you may find errors in the code or room for improvement to make it more efficient. I hope it may prove useful, specially for those of you who just commence your adventure in the world of quantitative finance.
